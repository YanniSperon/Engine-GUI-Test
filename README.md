# Andromeda Engine GUI Test
Pairing GUI interaction with primitive engine, uses Dear ImGui and only supports simple model loading and placing. The rendering engine is currently being worked on [here](https://github.com/YanniSperon/OpenGL-Playground) and the custom GUI library is being worked on [here](https://github.com/YanniSperon/GUI)
